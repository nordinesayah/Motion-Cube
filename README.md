# Motion-Cube

Creation of an application to learn how to use UIGestureRecognizer, to retrieve user actions on the screen, and CoreMotion for device orientation in an application that will make you play with small squares and small circles. These shapes will be subject to laws of physics such as gravity, elasticity and collision using a UIDynamicAnimator.
